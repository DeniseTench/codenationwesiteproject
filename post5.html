    <h1>How I Delivered on My Goals</h1>  

    <p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 1 - 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes' version control?</em></p>  

    <p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 2 - 2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello.</em></p>  

    <p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 2 - 2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools you selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello etc.</em></p>  

   <h2>How the Right Tools Helped Me Complete my Website</h2>  

    <p>As outlined on my <a href="https://trello.com/b/DHqJvtQN/code-nation-assignment-1-consultancy-website">Trello board,</a>  I selected <a href="post4.html">a number of tools</a> to help me publish my website within the deadline I was given.</p> 

    <h2>Planning</h2> 

    <div class="container2">
        <div class="row">
        <img src="images/trellologo.png">
        </div> 
    </div>
    
    <p>I chose <strong>Trello</strong> to plan, visualise and keep track of my website project as I have used it for several years and knew it would perform well for this purpose. During this project, it was among my most-used pieces of software. I believe it was a good choice and I would use it for future projects as it offered the below plus points.</p> 

    <p>You can find my project's Trello board <a href="https://trello.com/b/DHqJvtQN/code-nation-assignment-1-consultancy-website">here.</a></p>

    <ul> 
    <li>Speed - Trello is based entirely online, so I could access it on any device I chose 24/7. Any changes I made to the content or cards was  instantly saved, removing the need to back up data manually.</li> 
    <li>App and desktop - Further to the above, Trello is available as an app, so I could download it to my phone if I was on the go, or outside when an idea or a request to change something came to me.</li> 
    <li>Collaboration - A great advantage of Trello is its collaborative nature. Making a board public can give anyone you choose access to a project's overview. This is particularly helpful when working with clients, as demonstrating progress offers reassurance that a project is on-track.</li> 
    <li>Price point - Trello's basic version is free to use, which is ideal for any digital project with no or a modest budget.</li> 
    </ul> 

<p>Disadvantages of using Trello are few as far as I have encountered, but if you had not downloaded the offline version, the fact an internet connection is needed to work on changes may be a hindrance on the move when a connection is unavailable.</p> 

<p>After some consideration and trying out alternatives, I chose <strong>Figma</strong> to create a site map and wireframes. quickly and efficiently in the plain style I wanted within my timeframe. I also used it to draw out my basic sitemap structure. I decided on <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> as the other two pieces of software I had in mind didn't perform how I needed them to.</p> 

<ul> 
    <li>Speed - I found Figma to be easy and intuitive to use.</li> 
    <li>App and desktop - As Figma exports sometimes comple boards into PNG files, this was ideal for my project to give a general overview of my planning process.</li> 
    <li>Free and cloud-based - As you work so closely with wireframes and sitemaps at the outset, it was important that I couls access my work on any device I needed to, in case I thought of an idea while on the move.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Communication</h2> 

<div class="container2">
    <img src="images/slacklogo.png">
    </div>
   
<p>For communicating with the managers who set my website brief and peers with who I could share tips and ideas, I used <strong>Slack</strong> and <strong>Zoom</strong>.<br> 

<p>Again, I have used Slack previously, when I first started studying software engineering. It appears to be an indispensable tool for those int he tech industry, so I wanted to build my skills with this software. Slack was perfect for my website project for the below reasons.</p><br> 

<p><strong>Slack</strong></p>  

<ul> 

    <li>Convenience - Slack allows you to receive notifications and messages under the circumstances you choose. You can adjust the notification settings so it does not alarm between certain hours. You can also join and flit between different channels to discuss projects with various people in the right context. Slack messages are also instant, so you receive them the second they are sent, unlike emails with large attachments.</li> 

    <li>App - Although this is true of most software, Slack's android app deserves a special mention as it is very quick and easy to install operates as an instant messenger, posting notifications on your mobile home screen as they come in. Additionally, I have never known it to crash or stall on my devices.</li> 

    <li>Collaboration - Slack allows you to communicate and collaborate with the people working on the same projects. You can message multiple users on a group basis, or send messages privately one-to-one. It also has integration with other sharing software such as Dropbox, Zoom and Trello, which allows you to share links to content with greater ease.</li> 

    </ul> 

<p>I have yet to come across any disadvantages to using Slack and will use it again for future projects.</p> 

<div class="container2">
    <img src="images/zoomlogo.jpg">
    </div> 

<p><strong>Zoom</strong></p> 

<ul> 
<li>Multiple call participants - The main reason why I chose Zoom for this project was that it allowed me to be on a video call with multiple users. Skype and other VOIP protocol doesn't have this facility. I found this to be the strongest feature of Zoom and sometimes was on a call with ten people or more.</li> 
<li>Easy screen sharing and host swapping - Another advantage of Zoom is that it's very easy to share screens, chat by text or to make someone else a host of your call, for example. This is largely down to its clean user interface, which adds to it being intuitive to use, even for those unfamiliar with the technology.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The disadvantages of Zoom include the free version only allowing 40 minutes per meeting. However, there is a workaround for this of generating another meeting link. Another drawback for me was that if you use the invite system, call participants need a meeting ID and a password, both of which are generated automatically by Zoom. As a result, they are always long and difficult to remember, so it can create delays to joining calls. Additionally, another problem I encountered with Zoom on this project was unreliable connectivity. Many times I was kicked off and then re-admitted to a call without warning, or the speakers' screen froze, was disrupted and I missed important points in a conversation. I usually use Skype for my business meetings, but could not on this project due to the need for multiple collaborators being on video chat. An alternative could be Google Hangouts or WhatsApp. I may explore these further before using Zoom on future projects.</p> 

</ul> 

<h2>Graphics</h2> 

<div class="container2">
    <div class="row">
    <img src="images/canvalogo.png">
</div>
</div>

<p>I used <strong>Canva</strong>, <strong>Abode Kuler</strong> and <strong>Google Fonts API</strong> to help me create graphics, find a colour scheme and font families for my website.</p>

<p><strong>Canva</strong> was my tool of choice for designing graphics. Usually I would use the products from the Adobe suite, such as Illustrator or InDesign. However, as there were not a great number of graphics to create or images to manipulate for this website, I decided to keep things very simple with Canva's templates.</p> 

<ul> 
<li>Templates - Canva's selection of templates and fonts, all available for free, plus its speedy download function and conversion to PNG files, was my main motivation for choosing it to create the few graphics needed for this project. It allowed me to use the colour palette I chose and the font I selected to create a personal brand identity. </li> 
<li>Intuitive UX - The user experience (UX) of Canva works in its favour as it is very intuitive. It allows you to find what you are looking for and adapt it you your digital project's needs quickly and easily.</li>        
</ul> 

<p><strong>Adobe Kuler</strong></p> 

<p>I used <strong>Adobe Kuler</strong> to select a colour scheme for my website, to help create a personal brand and apply it consistently using CSS and SASS in tandem. I chose Adobe Kuler from past experiences and because it is connected to my Adobe creative cloud account. This means that when I see a colour scheme I want to consider, I can bookmark it or add it to my library across all Adobe products I use. All colour schemes are available to download in hexadecimal, RGC and CMYK formats. You can also thank the designer of a colour scheme you like by clicking an 'appreciation' button.</p> 

<p>For me, Adobe Kuler and Google Fonts API are systems I haven't experienced issues with and ones I use time and time again. The only drawbacks I experience to using Canva is that its free version is restricted to using templates, which does not allow for a lot of freedom in formatting. Plus, the fact it so popular means that your graphics may lack individuality in your marketplace. However, these are small drawbacks for the plusses of convenience and speed that it offered me on this project. </p> 

<h2>Content</h2> 

<div class="container2">
    <div class="row">
    <img src="images/onenotelogo.jpg">
    </div>
</div>

    <p>As a Microsoft user of 20 years, a Hotmail account holder and Office subscriber, I went with the reliable option of using <strong>Microsoft OneNote</strong> to draft, proofread and edit my content. Its advantages for this project were as follows.</p> 

    <ul> 
        <li>Anytime, anywhere editing</li> 
        <li>App - The OneNote app is particularly functional, to the point where I feel comfortable writing on a small mobile phone. It has a multi-layer ordering system, so you can create notebooks within notebooks. It allows you to 'scan' documents using screenshots, add images to your notes and create tick lists, and saves work instantly, which I think is particularly impressive for a cloud-based text editing app. It also reduces the chance of losing important work when an internet connection is shaky. I have yet to lose any work due to the OneNote app.</li> 
     <li>Integration with everyday software - <strong>OneNote</strong> can work alongside other Microsoft software, such as Word and Powerpoint, for fast pasting and carrying across formatting and  colour schemes.</li> 
        </ul> 

    <h2>Coding</h2> 

    <div class="container2">
        <div class="row">
        <img src="images/vscodelogo.png">
    </div>
</div>

    <p>I used <strong>VS Code </strong>to code my website in HTML and CSS, using Sass and Bootstrap. I started using VS Code only nine months ago at the beginning of my software developer career change journey. It's clear to me why it is the tool of choice for many developers. Like Wordpress, it allows you to download add ons for greater functionality and the library of these is very large and updated regularly. Some of the other plus points of <strong>VS Code</strong> are below.</p> 

<ul> 
        <li>Automatic error identification</li> 
        <li>Inbuilt Terminal</li> 
        <li>File-handling Capabilities</li> 
        <li>Cross-language functionality - It doesn't matter which language you're coding in, VS Code can identify this from the file name and accommodates a wide range. On this project alone, I used VS Code to write in HTML, CSS and to use Sass and Bootstrap.</li> 
</ul> 

 <p>The only frustrations I have with VS Code are minor and are far outweighed by the benefits. The auto tag system is sometimes cumbersome, as it involves deleting unwanted tags that VS Code places. Additionally, every time I open a new file, I have to press 'ALT + Z' to apply text-wrapping. It would be much better if the programme remembered and stored my preferences between files.</p>  


<p><strong>Bootstrap for responsive design</strong></p>

<p>It's important to me that the design and layout of my website is responsive. I want users to be able to have a consistently positive experience while browsing my site. This should be regardless of which browsers and devices they are viewing it through. For this reason, I researched and chose Bootstrap's responsive grid layout. I like that it can be applied to both text and graphics, by ordering all content into a container, then from there, parent and child elements of rows and columns. I decided to optimise for four screen sizes - extra small, small, medium and large, using Bootstrap's 12-space flexible grid system.</p>


<h2>Testing</h2> 

<p><strong>Browserling</strong></p> 

 <p>The benefits of using at least one browser to test a web page are clear and important. For my website project, <a href="https://www.browserling.com/"><browserling</a> enabled me to see how Mozilla Firefox would render my code and content. After publishing my website using GitHub Pages, I chose to review my coding and content using Mozilla, as it is one of the most popular browsers in use today, behind my primary browser, Chrome. The render previews allowed me to see if any components I had coded were proving problematic across  different browser from the one I coded in. It also enabled me to understand the experience of the end user. I analysed my site on both browsers. As Mozilla's rendering is similar to that of Chrome, the page I sampled looked identical in Firefox, so I decided not to make any changes. If I spot any discrepancies in future, I will review this.<p> 
   
<h2>Publishing</h2> 

<p><strong>Github and Github Pages</strong> are tools I could not have completed this project without and are indispensable to software developers. Github allowed me to upload my repository, which includes a README file and clearly shows my coding and reasoning throughout. Github pages allowed me to make my work public and demonstrate my project to future employers and peers.</p> 

<div class="container2">
    <div class="row">
    <img src="images/githublogo.png">
</div>
</div>

<p>I wouldn't consider using any alternative to Github, unless circumstances made it necessary. It is the gold standard software in its category. When it comes to Github pages, there are many alternatives and for a project requiring an independent domain, I would use either a ready-made CMS, such as Wordpress, AEM or Drupal. Alternatively, if I was making a site from scratch and it was very simple with no need for plugins and themes, I may upload my root folders using my host's website and FTP such as Filezilla.</p>     

<h2>Review of Tools and Ongoing Upgrades</h2>

<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 2 - 2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools you selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello etc.</em></p>  

<p>After having evaluated the tools I used above on an individual basis, I can conslude that overall, I'm happy that the tools I perform the functions I need them to.</p>

<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 2 - 2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello.</em></p>  

<p>It is entirely possible that alternative and improved pieces of software are developed in future. I believe, as a software engineer and someone in the tech industry, it is vital to be aware of and stay on top of any new software published that can change the game for projects such as this.<br>
    
For example, GitHub may introduce an extra function or there may be a brand-new wireframing app that is faster and more intuitive than the one I usually use. <br>
    
In my opinion, it is important to stay updated with news and developments by sharing ideas with peers, reading about what your competitors are doing, attending tech meetups, talks and webinars and subscribing to ech news and websites in order to tap the possibilities of new software and apps.

Should any software launches, upgrades, or updates take place that I believe will improve this site and enhance UX, I will implement them on my website and detail any changes I have made in my Github README file.</p>
