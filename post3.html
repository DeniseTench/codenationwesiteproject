<h1>Why Do Digital Projects Fail?</h1>

<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 1 - 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects. What causes digital projects to fail? Why?</em></p>

<p>Challenges, curveballs and just plain unforeseen circumstances are all part and parcel of any project, digital or otherwise.</p>

<p>If you ask anyone who has worked on a project of any scale whether this is normal, the answer would be a resounding "yes."</p> 

<p>Encountering roadblocks, finding workarounds, negotiating and flexing to solve problems are all skills any tech professional needs to execute projects successfully and stand out from the crowd.  

<p>After all, as Franklin D Roosevelt once said</p>

<blockquote>A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.</blockquote>

<p>Every project is unique. Further still, every team member has a particular set of skills, history, approach, outlook and way of working with people. These factors make it difficult to pinpoint general reasons why digital projects may fail.  

<p>However, there are some patterns that can be identified. Using my experience as a tech consultant, I have whittled down the many reasons for project failure into three broad categories. Let's take a look.  

<h2>Problem 1: Inadequate Planning</h2>

<p>If you examine the myriad reasons as to why digital projects fail, many can be traced back to ineffective planning. So many issues may be down to this.</p>

<p>Perhaps a project over-ran its budget. Maybe the deadline was missed. Maybe a flood damaged vital equipment or a terrorist threat closed down a key building.</p>  

<p>All of these things and many more can be attributed to inadequate planning.</p>

<h3>What's the Solution?</h3>

<p>Although it may seem like the A,B,C of any project, a plan has to incorporate the fine details and include solutions to worst-case scenarios. If not, there is always the chance that something will be overlooked.  
 
<p>In my experience as a tech consultant, taking the below approach can mitigate problems and is a great way to begin project planning.</p>  

<ul>
        <li>Once the brief has been defined, gather every stakeholder involved in delivering the project. Together, create a visual map of the project and how long each stage will take. Allocate each stage to the teams working on them. Ask them to map each task to the letter.</li>  
        <li>Put all stages together. As a team, walk through the processes that will get you to the end point. Review the process to ensure nothing has been missed.</li>  
        <li>Work out and agree on key deadlines as a team. Clarify which methods will be used to communicate, share and update the project plan and track deadlines.</li>  
</ul>
 
<p>Even with the best-laid of plans, problems may still arise during a digital project. But with a meticulous approach, they're unlikely to be significant enough to derail the entire thing.</p> 

<h2>Problem 2: Poor Communication</h2>  

<p>This is a problem that touches all of our lives at some point, both personally and professionally. It is so easy to think that you've told someone exactly what you intend to do, but to accidentally miss a vital detail or to discover a discrepancy in understanding.   

<p>For example, I may tell you I'm having a sandwich for dinner and we could both walk away assuming we both understand this information. However, me being from Liverpool, dinner happens at 12pm, whereas someone from Bristol, for example, sees dinner as the thing you eat at 7pm. See how easy it can be?</p>

<p>Sometimes, miscommunication isn't necessarily anyone's fault. Other times, it can be down to stress or forgetfulness.</p> 

<h3>What's the Solution?</h3> 

<p>Any well-planned digital project needs tried-and-tested methodology for effective communication.</p>

<p>One of these is <a href="https://bit.ly/2Mi8wsG">Agile project management</a>. Whether <a href="https://bit.ly/3eBXKcS">scrum</a> or <a href="https://bit.ly/2ZXwHon">kanban</a>, Agile working is designed to set a team up for the best possible communication.</p> 

<p>Daily standups ensure everyone has visibility of their colleagues' progress, priorities and tasks for the day. It also offers the opportunity to identify collaboration opportunities and chances for problem-solving.</p> 

<h2>Problem 3: Lack of a Clear Brief</h2>  

<p>Unfortunately, there is not much the individuals working on a project can do if a brief they are handed is not consitent or lacks direction or definition.</p>  

<p>As with all initiatives depending on top-down direction, if the teams working on it cannot clearly see what it is trying to achieve, it can lead to disillusionment, demotivation and the failure of the project.</p>  

<h3>What's the solution?</h3>  

<p>If you find yourself working on a project team, or even the project manager, if there are any discrepancies betwen the guidance, targets or end goals, it always pays to flag these.</p>

<p>This may be with a superior who handed you the brief, or a larger team of people who helped define it.</p>

<p>If the issue is a simple error, they will be relying on you to spot it and point out anything that may cause confusion among those attempting to execute it.</p>

<p>Remember problem two - not communicating effectively can lead to serious problems. Don't be afraid to speak out and make your voice heard and be honest about any setbacks you see on the horizon.</p> 

<h2>Opportunity in Adversity</h2> 

<p>Every digital project I have worked on has come up against at least one challenge. If you find yourself looking one in the face, don't get tangled in the tactical detail.</p>  

<p>You may have a looming deadline, but there is always time to stop briefly, stand back and ask colleagues, peers and mentors for their opinions.</p>  

<p>Also, remember that problems can be turned into opportunities. Maybe the agency you were relying on to create video content has pulled out. This could lead to you sourcing an agency which can deliver in half the time and produce a better result. 

<p>Perhaps some accounts vital to the project were hacked. This could present an opportunity to create a foolproof password protocol later on that could be rolled out on a large scale. 

<p>At the end of any digital project, it's not the challenges that define the outcome. Rather, how you worked around them to produce an on-brief end product will be what steals the show for your clients.
