    <h1>GDPR, Copyright and their Impact on Digital Projects</h1>

    <p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 1 - 1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects. How does GDPR impact digital projects?</em></p>

    <p><em>Unit 2: Outcome 1 - 1.5 - 1.5 Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</em></p>
    
    <p>In May 2016, the EU unveiled the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a legal framework designed to harmonise and simplify disjointed data protection laws across European countries.</p>
            
    <p>Its aim is to support the rights of consumers to know who holds data on them, to gain assurance they are using it for its original purpose and that it will be kept for no longer than necessary.</p>
            
    <p>The GDPR did not replace the UK’s Data Protection Act 1998. Rather, it is designed to work alongside and clarify some of the conditions within it pertaining to the collection, retention and discarding of data for commercial purposes.</p>
            
    <h2>When was the GDPR implemented in the UK?</h2>
            
    <p>GDPR was implemented in the UK on 25th May 2018. This timeline allowed businesses two years to adjust their policies, best-practice and routines for gathering storing, protecting, disclosing and discarding data in the long-term.</p>
            
    <h2>But Haven't We Left the EU?</h2>
            
    <p>As well all know, the UK’s exit from the EU is an unprecedented situation that’s still in the process of being negotiated. The government’s stance so far is that the GDPR will apply in the UK. Regardless of what Brexit has in store for us, it’s advisable for businesses to conform to GDPR than to find themselves in breach of it and facing hefty penalties.</p>
            
    <h2>Isn’t GDPR a Marketing Issue?</h2>
            
    <p>Some people mistakenly assume that compliance with GDPR lies solely with marketing. This is because marketing is traditionally the department that campaigns for, collects and uses consumer data to communicate with target audiences.</p>
            
    <p>However, marketing isn’t the only department of a business that collects, handles and governs data. Finance, HR and IT for example are also likely to hold data on individuals and will therefore need to be aware of and comply with GDPR.</p>
            
    <h2>What are the Consequences of Breaching GDPR?</h2>
            
    <p>Before its introduction, fragmented data protection laws were in place across many countries in Europe. GDPR was the EU’s attempt to implement serious changes to protect consumers’ rights. Compliance is something that is entirely expected of businesses and the penalties for breaching it are high.</p>
            
    <p>They can range from a warning in writing for cases of first and non-intentional non-compliance, to regular data protection audits. Worst-case scenario are fines of between 2% to 4% of a company’s annual worldwide turnover up to a sum of one million to two million Euros.</p>
            
    <h2>Demonstrating Accountability for Collecting, Guarding and Storing Personal Data</h2>
            
    <p>If the digital project you're working on includes the collection and retention of personal data from individuals based in the EU, GDPR will affect it. </p>
            
    <p>There are a host of details to consider, depending on the size of your project and the scale of the records you plan to keep. However, below are three universal starting points to consider.</p>
            
    <h3>Obtaining Informed Consent, Detailing Purpose and Disclosing Timelines</h3>
            
    <p>Under GDPR, it is not acceptable to collect data without explicit consent, or active opt-ins, from an individual. The pre-ticked boxes to opt people into email newsletters are a thing of the past.</p>
            
    <p>If a digital project involves processing data for multiple purposes, the individual must be made aware of and grant their consent for each project.</p>
            
    <p>Companies must also disclose how long they intend to keep the data and this must be for no longer than necessary to complete the specific purpose detailed.</p>
            
    <h3>Requests for Information, Abolition of Subject Access Fees and Portability</h3>
            
    <p>As well as ensuring individuals are informed and consent to their data being processed, businesses must be willing to disclose what data they hold on them and respond to those requests within one month.</p>
            
    <p>At the current time, companies can charge a £10 subject access fee for information requests. Under GDPR however, charges will not be allowed unless requests can be deemed unreasonable (e.g. excessive or complex). In addition, the individual will have the right to request that their data is provided in a portable format and shared between third-parties, if required.</p>
            
    <h3>Breach Notification</h3>
            
    <p>Another notable feature of GDPR is its heavy enforcement when it comes to data breaches and their timely reporting.</p>
            
    <p>Breaches likely to result in risk to an individuals’ safety are required to be reported within 72 hours of their discovery. Where the risk is deemed to be high, companies must attempt to report the breach directly to the individual as quickly as possible.</p>
            
    <p>This summaries the main considerations that will need to be taken on board while planning a digital project. However, there are other areas to consider, depending on the aims and scope of your project. These may include consent requirements for gathering data from minors and privacy by design.</p>

    <h2>Copyright Issues Affecting Websites</h2>

    <p>When choosing and writing content to populate a website, it's important to be certain that the content is owned by you or your client. If not, you have to ensure that you've been granted the appropriate permissions to use that content.</p>

    <p>Common website content that is subject to copyright includes imagery, fonts and copy. You must take care not to plagiarise - even unwittingly - any content you write or use online. If you are unsure about this, you can run content through a plagiarism checker, or simply through a search engine to ensure it is original.</p>

    <h3>Sourcing Best-Practice</h3>

    <p>All quotes, sayings, extracts and any other material you know does not originate with you must be appropriately cited with a live source. If that source is secondary and you cannot find the original issuer of the information (such as a press release or an announcement directly from a company, for example) you must reference two sources that give the same information.</p>
        
    <p>For example, two online news articles that reported on the same subject.</p>

    <h3>Sourcing Images and Legitimate Use</h3>

    <p>Images are particularly worth being careful about. Never use a picture you have pulled directly from a search engine or any other source without gaining permission from the photographer, graphic designer or copyright owner first.</p>
    
    <p>Sourcing original imagery is always the preferable route to go down when creating any content. You can make your own images or graphics using software such as Abode Illustrator, InDesign or Photoshop.</p>
    
    <p>However, if this is not practical, there are numerous free image libraries online, such as <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a>. You can also use photography websites, such as Flickr, to find a piece of original photography that complimnents your project. You can then contact the photographer to request permission to use their work. Often, they will consent, provided you cite their work so they're credited as the artist.</p>
