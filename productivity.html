<h1>Productivity Reflection</h1>
    
<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency - could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</em></p>

<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency. </em></p>
    
<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects - what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</em></p>

<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</em></p>

<h2>IT Tools for Productivity and Efficiency</h2> 

<p>For easy reference, I have used a table format to present these thoughts.</p>  

<table style="width:80%"> 

    <tr>
      <th>Tool</th> 
      <th>Productivity Positives</th> 
      <th>Productivity Negatives</th> 
    </tr> 

    <tr> 
      <td>Slack</td> 
      <td>Instant communication for solutions to problems and accessing what you need quickly.</td> 
      <td>Instant communication. This can simultaneously be a negative as it can distract you from a task, especially if you're in sprint mode.</td> 
    </tr> 

    <tr> 
      <td>Trello</td> 
      <td>User experience - Trello seems to have been designed with making users' lives easier in mind. It is intuitive, has a clean, welcoming interface and is generally extremely accessible. </td> 
      <td>Functionality - If you are new to Trello or have not taken the deeper tutorials, you can take yourself down a rabbit hole and get distracted by looking into how you can improve your cards, notifications and appearance etc when you are mid-task.</td> 
    </tr> 

    <tr> 
      <td>Zoom</td> 

      <td>Thorough communication and sharing functions - Zoom is a positive for productivity, as t is easy to visually and verbally share vital materials through file-sharing or screenshots.</td> 
      <td>Sometimes Zoom calls could be an email or an instant chat. So I find that it may be better to think about the best way to communicate simple points before automatically defaulting to a full Zoom video chat, as it may take up more time than it needs to.</td> 
    </tr>

<h2>Ideas for Improving Efficiency on This Project</h2> 

<p> 
<ul> 

<li><strong>Worked more efficiently, not harder - </strong>It is often said that working harder does not equal working better and that there are ways you can try to maximise your time, rather than simply spend more time on something. I have used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> in the past and have found it to eb particularly effective for me.</li> 


<li><strong>Explore the Zeigarnick Effect - </strong>At a conference last year, someone highlighted <a href="https://bit.ly/2Yro6rQ">the Zeigarnick Effect</a>  and I have intended to try it on a project ever since. Apparently, this method was used by Ernest Hemingway to stimulate his thought process and ideas, which can only be a good thing, considering his success.</li> 


<li><strong>Offer to Help Others with Their Work to Improve my Knowledge on the Fly - </strong>Some advice I have been given in the past is that when you help other people to learn, brainstorm and problem-solve, it makes you much better at a subject. This is because it allows you to think about the processes and tasks much more thoroughly and map out just how it needs to be executed.</li> 

</ul> 
</p> 


<h2>Productivity - What I Would Do Differently </h2> 

 

<p>If I was to begin this project again, I would take a few steps to improve my productivity this time around. I would take more time at the beginning to incorporate and try the methods and techniques mentioned above. </p> 

 

<p>I would also take some more time to look at the functionality of the tools I used. This is so I can be sure that I'm taking advantage of their full functionality for speed and efficiency.</p> 

 

<p>A final thing I would do in order to improve productivity and efficiency is down tools and listen a little more. It is very easy to get caught up in your own tasks.</p> 

 

<p>Often this feels like progress. However, especially with coding, it is common to keep trying the same thing and chipping away at it until you get it right, referring to Stack overflow and problem-solving alone.</p> 

 

<p>I'm not sure this is always a good and idea and the most effective route. So, I would collaborate more with my peers and seek their advice and maybe even source a mentor for future projects.</p> 

 

<h2>Optimal Testing of Digital Solutions</h2> 

 

<p>In the case of this project, I tested the website I made by putting myself in the shoes of the end user. This involved testing their experience from beginning to end.</p> 

 

<p>As this is a website and it uses no functions or fields, I browsed my website, checked the colours and font sizes and spacing made it easy to read on-screen. I clicked on all links to ensure they were working.</p> 

 

<p>I looked at my website on both a mobile device (Huawei Honor 9 Lite phone) and two different laptop computers with varying screen sizes. I reduced and broadened the browser window to ensure the responsive elements I had coded in were fully functional.</p> 

 

<p>Finally, in light of the range of browsers and OS' on the market, I tested a page on my website that contains a lot of varying components to ensure it worked in three different browsers.</p> 

 

<p>I used the browser simulator <a href="https://www.browserling.com/">Browserling</a> to ensure my website was rendering as intended on Mozilla Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer. The results of these tests are stored in my Github repo as screenshots (file path: images/browser-screenshots)</p> 

 

<p>If this project involved the use of Javascript functions, I would have written code tests before beginning writing my code.</p>
