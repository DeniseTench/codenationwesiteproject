<h1>Selecting the Right Systems and Software</h1>

<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 1 - 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT. For example, making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</em></p><br>
<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 1 -1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software. How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</em></p>

<p>When beginning a digital project, a vital part of planning is to decide which tools you will need to fulfil the brief. Knowing which tools and software to use can be down to a variety of factors, including experience, advice and research.</p> 

<p>In the creation of this website, I selected which software I would use by considering my project in stages.</p>  

<h2>Planning Tasks and the Role of Trello</h2> 

<p>The Trello board I used on this project is <a href="https://bit.ly/2yTBhsF">here.</a></p>

<p>First, in order to have a visual representation of my project stages and timelines, I selected Trello. Trello was recommended to me by a client of mine several years ago and I have always used it since when beginning digital projects.</p> 

<p>In the case of my website, I created an entire board dedicated to it. Then I created several categories according to how I work best to break tasks down. These were project brief map, daily task lists, wireframing, planning and execution and post-publishing tasks. Within these categories, I added cards that broke down the tasks required even further. I attached images, including screenshots of wireframes and sitemaps and graphics I created using Canva to make visualisation clearer and easier.</p> 

<p>Another indispensable function of Trello I used at this stage was 'labels'. This allowed me to categorise all of my cards as 'to do' (marked in red), 'in progress (marked in amber) or 'done (marked in green).  Alongside this, I used the 'due date' function to mark each card with a deadline. I then set up auto emails so that Trello emailed me just before each task was due to be finished, which added to my motivation and timekeeping.</p> 

<p>Trello's options to style boards in various colours and to add cover images to each card helped me to style my board in the same colours and fonts as my website. This is always a nice touch for building a personal brand and consistency.</p> 

<h2>Choosing the Tools for the Job</h2>

<p>Below I have listed the tools I chose to create my project with in the timeline I had. To illustarate my reasoning, I have listed their primary advantage points.</p>
