<h1>Site Evaluation - The Good, the Bad and the Differently</h1>
    
<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 2 - 2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project. Are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</em></p>

<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 2 - 2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</em></p>
    
<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 2 - 2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</em></p>
    
<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3> 

<p>It's always a challenge to evaluate your own work, as, arguably, you are incapabale of being objective. But this is my analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Content</strong><br>

I attempted to strike a balance between providing comprehensive answers, but making sure I retained a focus on the questions given. I believe my background in working on projects and in teams at large B2B organisations, the transferable skills I have brought from my marketing background and my former profession as a writer and creative helped with this.</p>

<p><strong>Design and Branding</strong></p>

<p>Again, my professional background in marketing, twinned with my academic background in art, design and branding, enabled me to think of the bigger picture at the design stage and attempt to make visual components consistent to create the impression of a unified brand.</p>

<p><strong>Layout</strong></p>

<p>Working in content and SEO, I know the importantce of ensuring users know exactly what a website exists for and what they are expected to do with it. I am a big believer in making sure a website has as few pages as it needs and that they are ordered in a logical way. Not only does this promote good UX, it also helps Google bots crawl your site quickly and efficiently and ensure that search engines do not penalise the content for being duplicated or cloaked. With my website, I have shared the sitemap on my <a href="https://trello.com/c/9RSeQiIH/12-site-map">Trello</a> board to point out exactly where all pages sit and why.</p>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<p><strong>CTAs</strong>

<p>Perhaps it's not vital as this is an academic/test site, but if I was a tech consultant using my website to generate leads I would need calls-to-action (CTAs). I would apply these to every page that aims to generate leads. I have not included any CTAs here yet, but it could be a good extension to the project to improve the site. It may also give me the opportunity to hone my CSS skills.</p>

<p><strong>Improve Responsiveness With Unified Image Sizes</strong></p>

<p>Although I used Bootstrap's responsive grid layouts, some of the pages are not rendering as responsive on mobile screens, due to the images being in landscape format. I would defintiely look to fix this by unifying the image sizes in image-editing software such as Adobe Photoshop, in future.</p>

<p><strong>Vary Components More</strong></p>

<p>Something else I would like to do, if I had the time to be more thorough, is to make use of more HTML and CSS components, such as tables, buttons and social media icons. While not vital, this would be more in line with what users see regularly and expect of the websites they visit and would help to personalise my site and brand further.</p>

<h2>Improvements I Could Make</h2>

<p>As examined above, some improvements I could and may make to my website include the below.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add CTAs.</li>
    <li>Unify image sizes with photo editing software.</li>
    <li>Include more HTML and CSS components.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Things I'd Do Differently</h3>

<p>If I had a time machine (I do, but I can't discuss that), there are a couple of things I would do differently on this website project. I would update Trello as and when I had completed or moved tasks around. Often, I updated my cards at the end of the day and struggled to remember everything I'd done. Staying on top of it in real-time would have been better.</p>

<p>Something else I would do differentl is allocate some time to research during the planning, or pre-planning, stage. This would have afforded the chance to take a look at similar websites and gain inspiration and ideas for my own.</p> 

<p>As it was, I designed it myself without any reference points. But I believe it is always good to tae the time to look around at what is going on in your chosen space or industry and bear in mind what peers are doing and what is trending.</p>

<h2>Monitoring the Site and Making Changes</h2>

<p>I will declare any changes I will make in the future to my website in my GitHub README file, as per the industry standard.</p>
