<h1>Inside a Tech Consultant's Toolkit</h1>

<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 1 - 1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully. What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </em></p>

<p>Tech consultants need to know that it takes to successfully complete a digital project. Below are some at-a-glance lists of the methods, skills and tools that may be required for the job.</p> 

<h2>Methods</h2> 

<ul>
<li>Planning - A project needs to be planned as meticulously as possible to ensure it has every chance of success. The planning process should initially involve the entire team that will be delivering it and include everything from budget management and deadline-setting to allocating tasks.  
<li>Communication - Inadequate communication is one of the core reasons why digital projects fail. Therefore, a mechanism must be put in place for effective communication and be easily accessible to all team members.</li> 
<li>Benchmarking – Most projects will have predecessors that have many or at least some things in common. It is important to look at the project brief and what is expected of you, alongside how similar results were achieved in the past, to define benchmarks and key milestones. After all, you need to know if you’re heading in the right direction along the way, rather than at the end.</li> 
<li>Reporting – Reporting is vital to evaluate the success of any project. For example, if the brief is to grow brand presence online and one of the KPIs is a 5% increase in engagement among 20 to 35 year-olds, you will need to pinpoint the software and methods you will use to extract the figures.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Skills</h2> 

<p>Whether working individually or as part of a team, the skills a digital project may require include the following.<p>

<ul> 
<li>Proficiency with one or more programming languages, including Javascript, HMTL, CSS.</li>  
<li>Experience in working on other digital projects, such as websites and apps.</li>  
<li>Patience, perseverance, versatility, problem-solving, ability to work well on a team.</li> 
<li>Awareness of or experience and training in using project planning methodologies, such as Agile.</li> 
<li>Ability to run tests on code and also test the end product as a user would experience it to ensure UX is on-brief.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2> 

<p>The resources a digital project needs for successful execution vary greatly, but some indispensable pieces of software include the below.</li>  

<ul> 

<li>Trello - For planning and task visualisation</li> 

<li>Github - For pushing projects to local servers, publishing sites using Github pages and pulling open-source/collaborative code.</li> 

<li>A code editor - Such as VS Code on a remote basis, or Codepen etc for online code storing and sharing.</li> 

<li>Wireframing - To share the vision of your project with others, wireframing is always a positive action and software such as Figma, Adobe XD and Mockflow.</li> 

<li>Graphics editors - Adobe suites for image and video editing, canva for attractive, on-trend text-based banners and graphics, for example.</li> 

<li>Hosting provider - Any digital project involving the publication of a website will need a hosting provider that can provide the server speed and space required.<//li> 

<li>CMS or FTP - When publishing a website or information to be accessed widely, you may decide to use a content management system (CSM) such as Wordpress or AEM, or if the project is more independent, file transfer protocol (FTP) may be needed, such as Filezilla.</lI> 

<li>Cloud-based text/data editors – Such as Google sheets, docs, Outlook Notes or Excel online.</li> 

<li>Presentation software - Such as Microsoft Powerpoint or, if collaborative, Google Slides or Prezi.</li>
