# codenationwesiteproject

This is a personal website created to fulfil the brief of Code Nation's three-week software development course. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Sass in its creation.

Find my full planning and reasosning here: https://trello.com/b/DHqJvtQN/code-nation-assignment-1-consultancy-website

I will update this file with any software upgardes, exchanges or improvements as time goes on.

I will review my website once a month to ensure it continues to function as required and in line with any browser upgrades and rendering changes.
