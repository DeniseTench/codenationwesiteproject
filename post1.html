<h1>Do Businesses Really Need Tech?</h1>

<p><em>Unit 1: Outcome 1 - 1.1 Describe the role of IT in modern business.</em></p>

<p>According to the Cambridge Dictionary, Information Technology (IT) is....
    
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="mb-0">"The science and activity of using computers and other electronic equipment to store and send information."</p>
      </blockquote>

<p>Sticking to this definition, businesses have been using electronic equipment since the 19th century. Since 1975, when the first computers were invented, their uptake accelerated.</p>
    
<p>However, it wasn't until the mid-90s that computers, twinned with the internet, shifted from 'nice to have' to 'must have' in offices around the globe.</p>  
    
<p>Over the last 25 years, technology has moved at an incredible pace and changed our lives indescribably.</p>
    
<p>In terms of businesses, the shift from analogue communication, data and image recording methods to digital models has perhaps been the most striking.</p>  
    
<p>To demonstrate the magnitude of this change and just how much businesses rely on IT today, we can compare the operations of a medium-sized business today to one operating in the mid-to-late 1990s.</p>

<h3>Businesses in The 1990s</h3>

<ol>
<li>Used print channels such as brochures and flyers to market products and services.</li><br>
<li>Used analogue film cameras and video cameras with tapes to capture images and moving pictures.</li><br>
<li>Relied on telephones for internal and external communication.</li><br>
<li>Managed customer calls through a switchboard system.</li><br>
<li>Accessed the internet occasionally via cables over telephone networks.</li><br>
<li>Accessed the internet occasionally via cables over telephone networks.</li><br>
<li>Spent time and resource scanning and sending documents via.fax.</li><br>
<li>Used resource, time and expenses for face-to-face meetings.</li><br>
<li>Employed people to sort through and send post daily.</li><br>
<li>Had secretaries taking meeting minutes manually in shorthand.</li><br>
<li>Captured customer data on paper or in spreadsheets</li><br>
<li>llocated space to storing lockable filing cabinets full of data and records.</li><br>

<li>Communicated with stakeholders through physical AGMs and annual reports.</li><br>
<li>Issued press announcements via. news agencies and news wire systems.</li><br>
</ol>

<h3>Businesses in 2020</h3>

<p>Fast forward to the year 2020. The same processes may look something like the below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Markets their products through digital channels, such as email marketing, PPC, affiliate marketing and social media.</li><br>
<li>Uses digital cameras and mobile phones to capture images and videos.</li><br>
<li>Offers customers multiple communication channels, including email, phone, live chat, Q&As, and social media.</li><br>
<li>Holds meetings remotely across multiple timezones with any number of participants using presentation software such as Powerpoint or Prezi and comms software such as Skype, Microsoft Teams or Zoom.</li><br>
<li>Accesses the internet 24/7 through the wireless fidelity system (WIFI), with no need for a physical wired network between sender and receiver.</li> <br>   
<li>In place of secretaries, employees manage and organise their own notes, comms, expenses, travel bookings and annual leave instantly 24/7 with software such as Microsoft One Note, Prezi, Trello, Workday and Concur.</li><br>
<li>Captures customer data using software such as Salesforce and Sage.</li><br>
<li>Tracks and reports metrics and ROI using software such as Salesforce, Talkwalker, Hootsuite and SurveyMonkey.</li><br>
<li>Issues announcements to the press via. their websites and distributes news to the press using email, social media or software such as Cision Point.</li><br>
<li>Stores customer and employee data securely using onsite, local or cloud servers.</li><br>
</ol>

<p>As this comparison illustrates, from HR to finance, from marketing to sales, from managing sensitive data to booking a meeting room, IT is vital to the running of any business in 2020.</p>
